    <h2>A year at Quansight</h2>
    <h3>2019-04-19</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I wanted to take some time to reflect over my past year at Quansight. However, I want to be clear here these are all my personal thoughts, not those of the company and many (all) are half baked. I have found it useful to iterate through some of my thinking on these topics, and hope that by sharing them I can hear other perspectives and evolve from those.</p>
<p>To start off with, Quansight has given me the opportunity to do work I didn't think I could ever get paid for. I get to work on open source all day, with many different wonderful people across the world.</p>
<p>It's a dream, and it's honestly a bit disconcerting to realize there isn't anywhere else I'd rather be.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean though that I don't sometimes feel overwhelmed and isolated. I really feel the "we are social beings" thing, working remotely every day. Our bodies know that other people don't exist only in issue comments form. To really be people, they have to be fleshy and close by.</p>
<p>However, this problem is relatively easily addressed. I notice my physical environment affects me heavily. If I work out in open spaces surrounded by other people, I feel lighter. And when having less transactional more open ended conversations with my colleagues also feels good. So it feels like I am moving in the right direction there, and feel supported by Quansight in figuring this out.</p>
<p>But, I have had another larger thing banging around in the back of my head for the last year. What is the "place" of open source in the world? I often hesitate to go broad like this, struck by a feeling that "this is not your problem, stay in your zone." But I know that the interesting parts of life are in the cracks between spaces, where it isn't anyone responsibility.</p>
<p>It's this nagging realization this space of open source that I feel I am getting to know rather well, that in fact I don't know it at all.</p>
<p>It feels different then when I worked in food service briefly, where the driving mechanisms seem to be more on the surface. People need to be fed, they pay you to feed them, you do the work, your conditions are dependent on labor law and the intentions of the owners.</p>
<p>But when I am building tools for "anyone" (mostly business and academia), I am much more detached from my place in the system.</p>
<p>And detachment is worrying. Detachment means a lack of control. And I think back to the Manhattan project, where the the smartest minds of a generation in physics allowed themselves to create tools that quickly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szil%C3%A1rd_petition">got out of their control</a>. As a consequence millions of peoples were killed as a show of geopolitical force and as an experiment of a new weapons system.</p>
<p>So in a concrete way, I am pretty unclear about who really OS is working for. I know that I love the opportunities I get to work with wonderful people across the world. And to have a feeling of collaboration and exploration. That's what originally drew me to open source. The sense that "Hey I can be a part of a group working together to solve problems and collaborate easily".</p>
<p>But you will notice that the "solve problems" is very abstract. When you are building Django plugins, you aren't helping anyone in particular (besides yourself). So you are intentionally avoiding the politics of your choices. From what I have been reading recently about the origin of "Open Source" over the term "Free Software" the intent was to make it less politically motivated and so more palatable to business use cases in general. Open source serves to sever the producer from the consumer of software.</p>
<p>If we take a step back, this seems pretty congruent with the general approach to "science". The idea that we are each exploring things and collaboratively putting together a body of knowledge for the world. That it should be open, cooperative, universally applicable, and accurate.</p>
<p>The most resonating analysis of science I have heard comes from the <a href="https://hemisphericinstitute.org/en/su10-tourism/item/879-su10-brief-historical-background-zapatista-movement">Zapitistas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term “Zapatistas” broadly refers to the group of people participating in the anti-globalization struggle for democracy and land reform in Chiapas, Mexico, organized around the EZLN (Zapatista National Liberation Front). With the goal of disrupting the state and creating a space for the “democratization of democracy,” the EZLN guerrilla forces, in cooperation with indigenous peoples, incited a rebellion in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas on January 1, 1994 (Carvey, 1998). Though the signing of NAFTA is generally agreed to be the most direct catalyst for the rebellion, additional significant factors include “a combination of ecological crisis, lack of available productive land, the drying up of nonagricultural sources of income, the political and religious reorganization of indigenous communities since the 1960s, and the re-articulation of ethnic identities with emancipatory political discourses” (Harvey, 1998).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They held a conference on science a few years ago(<a href="https://climateandcapitalism.com/2017/04/05/zapatistas-ask-scientists/">"Zapatistas urge scientists to join in building a better world"</a>) and there is a particular part that struck me:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t want to go away to the university, we want to build a university in our communities, for you to teach and learn alongside our peoples.</p>
<p>We don’t want to go to the big laboratories and scientific research centers of the metropolis; we want them to be built here.</p>
<p>Instead of army and police barracks, open air mines and fancy hotels, we want—constructed here, under our leadership and collective operation—astronomical observatories, laboratories, physics and robotics workshops, sites for the observation, study, and conservation of nature, and even a Large Hadron Collider or something that allows us to free the graviton from the hypothetical prison of that particle and to thus begin to determine, once and for all, whether the physicists who subscribe to String Theory are members of a frustrated neo-cult or a group of paradigmatic scientists.</p>
<p>We want to erect schools to train scientists, not workshops disguised as schools that only teach vocations that serve capitalism (cheap and unskilled labor), or that only serve to pass the time or for the bad governments, or whoever aspires to become them, to say they built new schools or institutes.</p>
<p>We want scientific study, not just technical study.</p>
<p>We don’t just want to know how to drive or repair a vehicle, a sewing machine, a carpentry tool, a microscope; we also want to know the scientific principles of mechanical movement and optic physics, what combustion is; we want to know that speed is not the same as acceleration; one shouldn’t confuse value and price.</p>
<p>We don’t want to enter those scientific and technological competitions that so enthuse the public and private universities in order to see which machine or machinist is best. We want to learn and do science and technology to win the only competition that is worthwhile: that of life against death.</p>
<p>We don’t want to go to the big cities and get lost there. And that isn’t because we don’t have the knowledge to do so—the kids who have been educated in the autonomous schools have a greater level of knowledge then those who were educated in the state-run schools—nor is it for lack of intelligence or money.</p>
<p>It’s because we do not want to cease to be what we are. And we are original peoples, indigenous, as they say. What makes us what we are is our land, our people, our history, our culture, and as Zapatistas, our struggle.</p>
<p>In sum, we want to understand the world, to know it. Because only by knowing the world can we make a new one, a bigger one, a better one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if we look around us, how can we use the tools we are creating in service to that fundamental fight of life against death?</p>
<p>If these abstractions we create with computers are useful, how can they truly touch people? How do they touch ourselves?</p>
<p>Maybe projects like Jupyter are successful because they circle around this core question. They were created by folks looking to enable themselves and their colleagues to do more. Travis worked on scientific computing in Python, because he wanted to analyze MRIs and by creating these libraries in Python, he could use Python to build a better world to do that kind of work in. This is what keeps projects honest, the loop between creator and user. The code becomes an extension of our ability to think. We are not creating software for sale, but as an extension of ourselves, a more articulate finger to rub over the Earth, to uncover what lies there.</p>
<p>But then we have these people who understand the tools and can breath them, but they are rarely those who need them most. As we become more specialized, we can lose touch with the reality around us, escaping into the imaginary worlds in the computer. So how do we make sure we don't lose touch? Or how do we move the responsibility over, share the weight? This seems to be a push for education and sharing. If I cannot trust myself to do anything useful, at least I diffuse that power/knowledge.</p>
<p>Or can I turn it inward? For example, I previously worked on some projects to analyze all the text I produced in a computational form (messages, text messages, etc) and gain insight from it. I live in a town, a state, a country. Shouldn't technology  be useful in understanding my context in those places? In helping us understand who live with, what is the reality around us?</p>
<p>And here is the link to politics. Without power and a community, what use are tools? You are alone, floundering for some place to move. So technology can be of no use, without that context.</p>
<p>Without our own context, we fall into that of our existing world, of others. When I shared this post with Zach Saylor, he responded most eloquently that open source fills those cracks which businesses are not good at solving. Standards and protocols cannot be driven by one companies bottom line, they must exist in service to larger goals of community and cooperation. So open source is an outlet valve, it lets the <em>people</em> inside the companies collaborate from the bottom up, to do the work they know needs doing but isn't in the interest of just their institution.</p>
<p>I attended the inaugural Compilers for Machine Learning conference this year, and the last talk was one on the MLIR project out of Google. It was billed as a space for all of us to work together. The excitement in the room afterword was palpable. All of these folks from competing companies were clamoring to find a way to share their work and collaborate.</p>
<p>The problem Quansight is going after is how to keep these spaces of collaboration open. How do we move the money around to support folks doing this kind of work that is vital to research and business, but exists outside of their immediate purview?</p>
<p>If we continue down this line of thinking, we see that the communities we are serving are the digital communities we have created. Here the politics of open source can become inward facing, so that we pivot from asking "How can we use these tools to serve humanity?" to "How can we use our power as communities of tool builders?" Because if we really are an integral part of the future of our capitalist society, then we can think about how to leverage this usefulness into influence. But we can see we are in a somewhat of a bind here. Many of these groups are built on a somewhat apolitical foundation. This is very useful for those who would like to see things continue as they are, without much turbulence. By internalizing a "code is all that matters, let's keep our personal opinions out of this" kind of mantra, the world of open source can meld itself exactly into the needs of the market. Questioning of those needs then fall against this fundamental pragma and so can be kept down.</p>
<p>But culture is mutable, and we are already seeing many currents pushing against this strain in our world. The relatively recent focus on codes of conduct is one example here, a recognition that we actually care about a lot more than code, we care about each other. And there are lots of experiments going on in the different communities around how to set expectation with outside entities that want to participate. In things like the external contributor guidelines in JupyterLab. Here we start to see the power of these groups come into play, by being able to set the ground rules for engagement.</p>
<p>And unlike some other standards bodies, there is no supreme organization that distributes power to decision makers. There are many power centers, each project has their own rules and guidelines and is mostly accountable only to its members.</p>
<p>They are a bit like intentional housing communities. Coming together over some core purpose, yes, out of some necessity, but also usually with some shared vision of the future. So this is already a great first step in terms of organizing, there is a natural assembly of interested parties. The next step is to grow the bonds here, to form trust, and to engage with each other in critical dialogue. To understand where we have the ability to put pressure, to influence a decision, or how we can show solidarity with different movements.</p>
<p>A primary part of that is self preservation. We need new folks to come in, to keep ideas alive and churning. We need to be reassessing our mission. So what do we stand for? From a larger context, open source is about pragmatism. It's the understanding that we may not have to agree on everything, but that humans together can do much more than they can alone. That we can see each other with respect and learn from one another, regardless of our background or location. It's an active imagining of how to build decision making from the ground up, how to work together, and how to communicate. But ultimately, we have a belief that things can be done, and progress can be made, that we can build things to serve one another and learn from this. Implicit is a sense of the possibility of linear progress and achievement, that there is a continual movement, as a collective hive mind, towards better solutions.</p>
<hr>
<p>After sitting with this for a few days, one way to tie a bow on it is to ask "What responsibilities and opportunities do people participating in open source have?" and to answer it in three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using the tools we build in ways that are productive</strong>: How to do "good" with open source? Well use the software to do things that are "good". This is what Ian Rose is doing in LA, he just took a job in the city government and is helping them using Jupyter to plan municipal transportation (I think, I don't know really what he is doing =P ). I see this work as meaningful, it's a pretty direct way to using the efficiencies gained from the software we are building to attempt to improve the everyday lives of normal people.</li>
<li><strong>Using our position as toolmakers to build power and pressure change</strong>: Instead of just asking "what can we do with our tools?"  we can also understand our role in furthering the interests of existing powers, like the companies who rely on open source and are part of these communities. For example, there was a (mostly unsuccessful from my outside perspective) attempt to change a licence of Lerna to disqualify certain entities from using it who were doing objectionable things from the point of view of one of the authors.</li>
<li><strong>Structure the tools we build in a way to empower people</strong>: This is the most interesting one for me and also the most questionable. The idea is simple, if we build foundations that are extensible, this allows many people to all work together on improving them, without having to coordinate directly. It's the leverage sense of coding, that it isn't the first order uses that are most important, but the second order ones. To take a concrete example, JupyterLab was built to be the next generation of editing Jupyter Notebooks. But it had another goal in mind as well, to be a space to build things like a notebook editor. The idea that "everything is a plugin" is an architectural choice that promotes certain social dynamics. It means a group can design their own use case for JupyterLab, and tie it into the core, without having to rewrite the world. Designing modular and compassable systems obviously isn't a new idea,  but the idea here is that this is a means to an end, where the end is greater collaboration and democratization of innovation. By defining protocols clearly and layering abstractions, we can make the space more accessible for a wide variety of people. The hope is that it isn't just those who work on the core system who can drive the community forward, that this kind of exploration can happen at the edges as well. This is an appealing narrative, because in it, implementing systems based on mathematical properties means that they are more composable and reusable. And these can then serve as a lever for ordinary people to amplify their voices.  It's a bit of a reach, I know, but it has an appeal for me personally. </li>
</ol>
<p>I am deeply appreciative of being able to work with so many wonderful people and have the sense of some sort of collective community collaboration. It sure beets doing things alone. I will be at PyCon this year, and if you are there, I would love to chat and hear your take on this space.</p>
