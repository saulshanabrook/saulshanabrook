<h1>2023-02-13</h1>

<p>Today is my first day of the recurse center.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://cindywu.org/@cindy/fourty-when-we-arrive-JapYEq">the blog of cindy wu</a>, I wanted to
experiment with putting words on the internet.</p>

<p>Most recently I had been trying writing things on Github Discussions, but alas, no more. There must be some parable
about developers continually writing new blog posts only when they create a new blog every year or so, to talk about
why the newest one is much better than the last one.</p>

<p>With writing HTML text, I also get the creepy side editor of the Github co-pilot, which I am not sure we can have
a real recoprical relationship with, since it just sits outside... But it keeps wanting to say things ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>This week I hope I can let the flow of the computer speak to me, and feel which way the wind blows, letting my
ego mind rest a bit as I make room for what is beneath.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write in markdown on my filesystem</li>
<li>Store it in github</li>
<li>Have it render as html!</li>
</ol>

<p>I just wish I didn't have to use a pre-processor or a some JS build system to get me there.</p>

<p>Could a web component help me out? They scare me! </p>

<p>Maybe for tomorrow. For now I'll stick with this</p>
