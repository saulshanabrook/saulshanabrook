### [metadsl](https://github.com/metadsl/metadsl)
a library to use pattern matching and type analysis to build safe
DSLs in Python, in order to allow scientific computing libraries to
better collaborate and share key abstractions.

maintainor for a while and helped on a variety of extensions as well

### [lineapy](https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy)
   a python code analysis tool, which helps productionize data science
    code by building a DAG of python code

## 🎭 Talks 🎭

### April 28, 2020: [Using Altair, Ibis, and Vega for interactive exploration of OmniSci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTl32fWhm6c)

> Altair is a lovely tool that lets you build up complex interactive
> charts in Python. Ibis is also a lovely tool that lets you use a
> Pandas, like API to compose SQL expressions in OmniSci and other
> backends. By tying them together you can use the familiar syntax
> of Pandas, combined with the expressive power of Vega and Vega
> Lite, to visualize large amounts of data stored in OmniSci. This
> talk will walk through a number of examples of using this pipeline
> and then go through how it works.

### December 8, 2019: [metadsl: separating API from execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdWdTPL7zrg)

> metadsl is a Python framework for writing APIs that are detached
> from how they are executed. With it we can be framework agnostic
> definitions of concepts like \"arrays\" and compile them to
> backends like Tensorflow or LLVM. In this talk, we will use
> metadsl to build high performance scientific computing libraries.

[PyData Austin
2019](https://pydata.org/austin2019/schedule/presentation/33/metadsl-separating-api-from-execution/)

### November 4, 2019: [Same API, Different Execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo6Amy3n7iE)
> Can the Python data science and scientific computing ecoystem remain
> in the hands of community open source projects? Or will
> increasingly complex performance and hardware requirements leave
> room only for vertically integrated corporate sponsored projects?

[PyData New York
2019](https://pydata.org/nyc2019/schedule/presentation/50/same-api-different-execution/)

### November 17, 2018: [uarray - Efficient and Generic Array Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAi8vgRakuk)
> Efficient array computing is required to continue advances in fields
> like IoT and AI. We demonstrate a system, uarray, that does array
> computation generically and targets different backends. We rely on
> a Mathematics of Arrays, a theory of shapes and indexing, to
> reduce array expressions. As a result, temporary arrays and
> unneeded calculations are eliminated leading to minimal memory and
> CPU usage.
